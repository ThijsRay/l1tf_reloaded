- Attempting to replicate RIDL, but without TSX
	- Need to do demand paging
- Bit confused about whether the address has to be aligned with the page size of cache line
- Turned out my FLUSH+RELOAD code didn't work because
	- My threshold was constantly wrong
	- Assembly itself was slightly wrong so I used the code from the FLUSH+RELOAD paper and that worked instantly
- I wrote some code that automatically finds a threshold for cache hits/misses. It worked very consistently but now it fails quite often. Not sure why
- RSB misspeculation works to run a piece of code speculatively
	- Mitigations only seem to address RSB misspeculation whenever a context switch happens, or whenever it is cross hyperthreads
- I know ret2spec works, but don't really get the process of MDS yet. Should look into this tomorrow
