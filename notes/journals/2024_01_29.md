- Debugging the RIDL PoC will probably take a while
	- Might need to look at performance counters and such to see if anything happens in the line fill buffer
- Change of plan: Maybe start with replicating the L1TF vunerability, specifically the L1TF one.
	- If I understand it correctly, even with mitigations like as PTE inversion and conditional cache flushes this should with on SMT sibling cores
- The Foreshadow-VMM paper describes the process of setting this up quite clearly, shouldn't be too hard I guess \*knocks on wood*
