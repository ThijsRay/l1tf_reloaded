- Use virt-manager to start two KVM virtual machines
	- Tricky with networking stuff but that seems to be solved by installing dnsmasq and adding this file https://github.com/libvirt/libvirt/blob/master/src/network/libvirt.zone
	- https://wiki.libvirt.org/VirtualNetworking.html
- Tried to have two VMs on the hwsec1 machine but it doesn't seem to support virtualization
- Need two programs
	- The victim program that just loads a value all the time
	- The attacker program that modifies the accessed bit of the PTE (ZombieLoad variant 3?) to cause a microcode assisted page walk
- After writing the programs, it doesn't work yet. Still only read 0's.
