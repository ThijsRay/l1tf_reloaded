- Had the weekly meeting, with these notes
	- Understanding Core Scheduling, a constraint for the scheduler to only schedule trusted processes simultaneously on the same core.
		- It can prevent leaking data from the other SMT thread.
		- Relevant, because it affects the guest-to-guest VM and the guest-to-host threat model
		- Core scheduling is opt-in, has to be enabled by the virtual machine manager
			- Seems to be done in Google Cloud and in Hyper-V
	- Trying different methods of generating a microcode-assisted load to replicate MDS attacks
		- So far, only the existing MDS PoC using TSX was successful, but that is not that useful in real systems anymore because TSX is disabled by recent microcode versions
		- Played around with demand paging, manually clearing the dirty/access bits in the page table entry
		- I might be misunderstanding the conditions in which MDS speculatively uses stale data
	- Simplified the RSB misspeculation code based on a suggestion by MathÃ©
- Tried my code with the [TSX assembly from the ridl PoC](https://github.com/vusec/ridl/blob/bdcc1a78cd8246719282befa7d3af8e7a2f1cb89/pocs/ridl_basic.c#L34), and I am getting some results
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1706296488852_0.png)
	- While it works, it also still relies on TSX and it doesn't generate a lot of results (this image is with 100k iterations)
	- ~~Also works with my own code on the hwsec1 machine (dereferencing NULL) ðŸŽ‰~~
	- Well wait a minute, maybe the threshold is incorrect because I don't see any of the values I write on sibling cores ðŸ«¤
- **Plan**: start with the RIDL PoC as a base (because that is confirmed to be working), and go from there because this very difficult to debug
