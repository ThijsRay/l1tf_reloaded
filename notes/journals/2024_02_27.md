- Tried a bunch of things to get systemd to work
- A custom kernel with busybox and a custom init script works instantly

	- Does systemd rely on some weird kernel flags that are present in the debian kernel but not in mine?
- Honestly, it doesn't really matter because I can compile the demo code statically and gdb on top of that
