- Tried to compile the kernel again but I got some strange error, trying to do a clean build again but with a lot fewer drivers enabled to hopefully speed it up
- Try to compile it on the hwsec machine because it has 8 cores (which is more than my laptop)
- A lot of attempts don't succeed, probably because I messed up some configuration
- Building again with the default debian config
	- `make olddefconfig && make bindeb-pkg`
	- Will take quite a bit longer because of all the drivers but at least it is easier this way
- Wow it actually booted now, now I have to test whether my change actually worked
- The fast segfault handler actually works!!
- Benchmarks
	- `(9.828 seconds) / ((10000 bytes) Ã— 4096) = 4.580179968 h / (64 GiB)`
	- 4.5 hours, which is still not great but it is an improvement
- Instead of userspace, let's write a kernel module to avoid the context switch
