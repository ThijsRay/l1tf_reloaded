- Tried to compile the kernel again but I got some strange error, trying to do a clean build again but with a lot fewer drivers enabled to hopefully speed it up
- Try to compile it on the hwsec machine because it has 8 cores (which is more than my laptop)
- A lot of attempts don't succeed, probably because I messed up some configuration
- Building again with the default debian config
	- `make olddefconfig && make bindeb-pkg`
	- Will take quite a bit longer because of all the drivers but at least it is easier this way
