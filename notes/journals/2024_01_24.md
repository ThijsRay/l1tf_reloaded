- So why do we even get a micro-assisted load (as the ZombieLoad paper calls it)
	- This question exactly: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56187269/about-the-ridl-vulnerabilities-and-the-replaying-of-loads
- Reading Intel's technical description of MDS https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/intel-analysis-microarchitectural-data-sampling.html
	- > Assists are conditions that are handled internally by the processor and 
	  thus do not require software involvement. While both faults and assists 
	  may cause the results of a Î¼op to be discarded, assists restart and 
	  complete the instruction without needing software involvement, whereas 
	  faults do need software involvement (for example, an exception handler).
	  _For example, setting the **Dirty** bit in a page table entry may be done using an assist._
	- From the footnote (emphasis in last sentence is mine)
- Let's try it in a VM which modifies the page table to have
	- Two virtual addresses that point to the same physical address
	- Potential differences: dirty/access/user/present/swap bit are set or not, requiring an assist?
	- flush one page, read from the other speculatively?
- Does SMT sharing across VMs even happen/possible in the real world anymore?
	- Core scheduling + what hyper-V is doing
- Core Scheduling https://kvm-forum.qemu.org/2019/Core-Scheduling-Virtualization_KVMForum19_Faggioli.pdf
	- Guest-to-Guest does not seem possible if Core Scheduling is on and guests have different tags
	- https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/core-scheduling.html
	- Guest-to-Hypervisor does seem possible
- Core scheduling is opt in for user space processes, how about kernel space in KVM?
	- "Every VM is implemented as a regular Linux process, scheduled by the standard Linux scheduler" (https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-KVM)
	- This means that the virtual machine monitor like QEMU (so not KVM) is responsible for calling the `PR_SCHED_CORE` functions on the processes to separate them across cores
