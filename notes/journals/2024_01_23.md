- Got an explanation from Mathé about how RIDL seems to work
	- He also gave a suggestion of how to improve RSB misspeculation (without the recursive thing because that is only necessary if the victim doesn't cooperate
- Next steps after talking to Mathé
	- DONE Change RSB to be only 1 changed return pointer instead of the recursive stack, followed by a clflush and an mfence to ensure that the speculation window is REALLY long

- It seems like the triggering the exception or the microcode assist does not work in my current PoC. Different things to try could be
	- Modify the page table to force page faults in some way
	- Create a page that cannot be read
	- Copy on write page which isn't present type of fault?
